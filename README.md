# Home-library-management-system
 Every bibliographic artifact is registered, also with respect to its location on bookshelves. Books and journals may be lent to friends (other system users), and these facts are registered too. The system should enable users for searching over the global collection of the whole community, reserving books, borrowing and returning them.
